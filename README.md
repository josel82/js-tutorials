# JS Concepts
---

I have prepared a series of tutorials in which I try to explain in the most simplistic way I'm capable of some of the core concept of JavaScript. I hope these tutorials help you to understand these concepts and prepers you for next week exam.

- [Closures](closures.md)

If you have any question or suggestions, feel free to leave a comment.
